# Sign_Language

Imagine you came from battle; unfortunately, during the chaos, you lost your voice and cannot talk. You don't know ASL, and none of your friends do. There is no way for you to communicate with anyone and feel stuck. 

That is where I come in. I decided to create a sign language glove that covers the basics. Such as saying you are tired, hungry, relaxing, okay, and more. You only need to learn how much to bend your fingers. Depending on that, a message will appear on the screen with the message you are trying to get across. 

Now, what happens if you are in an emergency and can't call for help? Don't worry; I also created a little button you can push in case of emergencies. It will light up a red light and make a buzzer beep, indicating you need help.
